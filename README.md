# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the service) using Machine Learning techniques.

The goal is to help businesses identify high-risk customers and take proactive retention actions.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based businesses. 
By analyzing historical customer data, we can build a predictive model to identify potential churners.

- Account details
- Service usage information
- Billing & contract details

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
